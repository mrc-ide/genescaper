Description: Inputs data consisting of allele frequencies at sampling sites
    along with their latitude/longitude values. Fits a model of smoothly
    varying allele frequencies in space (a Gaussian Random Field) via Bayesian
    MCMC. Uses the fitted model to predict allele frequencies at any given
    point in space, and also to generate a null distribution for pairwise
    genetic distances between sites. This null distribution can then be used
    to detect outliers, which may represent sites that are more/less connected
    than we would expect by chance.
